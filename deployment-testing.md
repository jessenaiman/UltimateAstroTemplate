# Deployment Testing Strategy

## Pre-deployment Checks

### 1. Build Verification

```bash
# Clean install dependencies
npm ci

# Run build
npm run build

# Run all tests
npm run test
```

### 2. Test Coverage Requirements

- Unit tests: minimum 80% coverage
- E2E tests: All critical user paths covered
- Accessibility tests: No WCAG violations

### 3. Performance Checks

```bash
# Install lighthouse CLI if not already installed
npm install -g lighthouse

# Run lighthouse checks
lighthouse http://localhost:4321 --view
```

Performance requirements:

- Performance score > 90
- Accessibility score > 90
- Best Practices score > 90
- SEO score > 90

### 4. Static Analysis

```bash
# Run type checking
tsc --noEmit

# Check for unused exports
astro check
```

## Deployment Pipeline

### 1. Pre-deployment Stage

```bash
# Add these to your CI pipeline
npm ci
npm run test
npm run build
```

### 2. Staging Deployment

- Deploy to staging environment
- Run E2E tests against staging
- Run performance tests against staging
- Check all external integrations

### 3. Production Deployment

- Deploy to production
- Run smoke tests
- Monitor error rates
- Check analytics

## Automated Checks

Add this to your GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: Deployment Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: "20"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      - name: Run E2E tests
        run: npx playwright test

      - name: Check types
        run: tsc --noEmit

      - name: Astro Check
        run: astro check

  lighthouse:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run Lighthouse CI
        uses: treosh/lighthouse-ci-action@v9
        with:
          urls: |
            https://staging-url.com
          budgetPath: ./budget.json
          uploadArtifacts: true

  deploy:
    needs: [test, lighthouse]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to production
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        run: |
          # Your deployment commands here
